Create a subdirectory called myassignments under your <b>technologiesoutcomes</b> directory and change into it. Then clone the repository below into your myassignmnents subdirectory
```
git clone https://github.com/techoutcomes/assignments
```
Change into the assignment directory
```
cd assigments
```
Change into the relevant assignment subdirectory. For instance if you want to submit assignment2 work, change into the assignments2 subdirectory.
```
cd assignment2
```

While in assignment2 subdirectory, copy the student1 subdirectory to a new subdirectory with a name exactly matching your names - the names by which you are known on the platform. No spaces and only use lower case characters. You must retain this naming convention going forward.
```
cp -R student1 victorkatte
```

This will create a new subdirectory named with your names. Change into your new subdirectory and launch Visual Studio Code. Edit the README.md file and add your answers to the assignment questions. Save your work.


Change back to the root of your repository and push your change back to the main GitHub repository.
